RadioTunes Titanium SDK
===

This is a port of the [RadioTunes SDK](http://www.binpress.com/app/radiotunes-sdk-for-ios/596) component which was originally developed for the iOS platform. Now you can use this powerful radio streaming engine in your **Appcelerator apps** too and start writing radio apps in Javascript!

RadioTunes Titanium SDK is the definitive framework for Appcelerator app developers who want to add radio streaming & recording functionality to their apps. Behind the scenes RadioTunes relies on the iOS AudioQueue framework and the open source LGPL licensed FFmpeg library.

If your app does not require mms/wma codec functionality you can also use RadioTunes Titanium SDK without including the FFmpeg library. The code for mms streaming is completely separated from the code for http streaming so that you can choose which portions of code you want to include in your project.

Note: The demo project will only play radio streams for a limited time only.
